# of scripts for generating RSA certificates
# and private keys.  Remember to use
# a unique Common Name for the server
# and each of the client certificates.

# Any X509 key management system can be used.
# OpenVPN can also use a PKCS #12 formatted key file

# for OpenVPN to draw client addresses from.
# The server will take 10.8.0.1 for itself,
# the rest will be made available to clients.

# on 10.8.0.1. Comment this line out if you are
# ethernet bridging. See the man page for more info.

# the same virtual IP address from the pool that was
# previously assigned.

# Push routes to the client to allow it
# to reach other private subnets behind
# the server.  Remember that these
# private subnets will also need

# back to the OpenVPN server.

# If enabled, this directive will configure
